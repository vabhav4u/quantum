Quantum Random Bit Generator (Qiskit)

This project demonstrates a simple quantum circuit using Qiskit that generates a random output (`0` or `1`) by placing a qubit into superposition and measuring it.

The program runs on the Qiskit Aer simulator and does not require real quantum hardware.

## Installation

Make sure Python (3.8 or higher) is installed, then install the required modules:

```bash
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer

Program Overview

Uses a Hadamard gate to create quantum superposition

Measures the qubit to demonstrate quantum randomness
